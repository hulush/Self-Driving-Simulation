# Self-Driving-Simulation
Description

GOAL

The goal of the project was to train a Deep Learning to replicate the human steering behaviour while driving, thus being able to drive autonomously on a simulator provided by Simulator (Udacity). 
 - Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behaviour
 -  Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
 -  Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator.
